All plants and animals need water to survive and we Humans are one of them. Tanzania Government installed various pumps, to pump up groundwater to cater to this need. To maintain the continuous supply of potable water to Tanzanian communities, it is necessary to have all the water points functional. A smart understanding of functionality status can help in planning the maintenance work of water points and efforts could be done accordingly to have 100% functional water points.
